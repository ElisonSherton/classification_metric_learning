# Content Based Image Retrieval

In this repo, we take ideas from [Classification is a strong baseline for deep metric learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.12649.pdf) and implement them on the [Inshop dataset](https://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/DeepFashion/InShopRetrieval.html)

We end up with a model that can recommend clothing items related to a query clothing item provided by the user. 

[This blogpost](https://elisonsherton.github.io//deep%20learning/2022/05/02/Metric-Learning.html) explains the dataset, the problem statement and how to use this repository to train a model for retrieving clothing images.
